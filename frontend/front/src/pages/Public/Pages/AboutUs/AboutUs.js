              <b>The Boston Heat Pump Accelerator (BHPA)</b> works to support
              increased access for Boston homeowners to heat pumps and related
              resources, helping to reduce costs for residents, increase
              community resilience, and shift the region to low-carbon
              technologies. This initiative takes no funding from companies or
              heat pump installers - it supports overall access to heat pumps
              only, via education and awareness efforts.
