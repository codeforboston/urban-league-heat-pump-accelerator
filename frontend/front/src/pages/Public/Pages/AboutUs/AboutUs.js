            About the Boston Heat Pump Accelerator
          </Typography>
          <Typography mb={3}>
            <b>The Boston Heat Pump Accelerator (BHPA)</b> works to support
            increased access for Boston homeowners to heat pumps and related
            resources, helping to reduce costs for residents, increase community
            resilience, and shift the region to low-carbon technologies. This
            initiative takes no funding from companies or heat pump installers -
            it supports overall access to heat pumps only, via education and
            awareness efforts.
