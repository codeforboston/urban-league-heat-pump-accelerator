This focus reduces the likelihood that surveyors knock on the door of a home, only to find that the owner (who has the authority to make decisions about the heating system) is not only not at the home, but in fact does not even live there. In this situation, it would not be possible for this “door knock” to result in a completed survey. So the decision was made to focus on owner-occupied homes. With a very limited budget to support the time of surveyors, the project looked for ways to ensure that each survey-interaction had the highest “foundational” chance of engaging an eligible survey respondent.</p><p>To identify owner-occupied homes in the supported neighborhoods, the project analyzed the publicly available City of Boston property database.

Survey responses will be stored in a secure database and aggregated to illustrate the possible strengths and/or gaps in heat pump familiarity of the general public in these neighborhoods.</p><p>It is the the goal of this project that these insights on heat pump awareness in local communities can inform additional, comprehensive efforts to empower residents with information, context, options, and guidance around evaluating heat pumps as greener, more efficient, and less expensive HVAC solutions.</p>"
