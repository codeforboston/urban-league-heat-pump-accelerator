# Front end json-server

1. `yarn`
2. `yarn start`
3. You now have `json-server` running on port `3001`!

`data/` contains the "database" data. `.json` files have been exported directly from the back end, `.js` files have been created by the front end team.

`scripts/` contains scripts for managing the data.

`middleware/` contains `json-server` middleware used to mock out various non-CRUD features.
