# Urban League Heat Pump Accelerator Project

Technical support for the Urban League of Eastern Massachusetts ([ULEM](https://www.ulem.org/)) and the Heat Smart Alliance ([HSA]) to canvass owners of properties in Boston likely to benefit from heat-pump retrofits, tax credits, and installation support.
[Code for Boston](https://www.codeforboston.org/)'s work includes 5 streams:

* [`data-analysis`](/data-analysis/) identifying properties likely to benefit from heat pumps
* [`backend`](/backend/) building a database of such properties
* [`frontend`](/frontend/) developing an app to allow canvassers to view property information
* [`partnerships`](/partnerships/) contacting organizations that could apply this approach to their local area
* [`marketing`](/marketing/) sharing project work + outcomes
