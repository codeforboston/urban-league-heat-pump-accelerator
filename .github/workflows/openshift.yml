# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.

# üíÅ The OpenShift Starter workflow will:
# - Checkout your repository
# - Perform a container image build
# - Push the built image to the GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)
# - Log in to your OpenShift cluster
# - Create an OpenShift app from the image and expose it to the internet

# ‚ÑπÔ∏è Configure your repository and the workflow with the following steps:
# 1. Have access to NERC's OpenShift cluster Refer to https://nerc-project.github.io/nerc-docs/openshift/logging-in/access-the-openshift-web-console/. To get access NERC's OCP web console you need to be part of ColdFront's active allocation as described [here](https://nerc-project.github.io/nerc-docs/get-started/get-an-allocation/#request-a-new-openshift-resource-allocation-for-openshift-project).
# 2. Create the OPENSHIFT_SERVER, OPENSHIFT_TOKEN and IMAGE_REGISTRY_PASSWORD repository secrets. Refer to:
#   - https://github.com/redhat-actions/oc-login#readme
#   - https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets
#   - https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_secret_set
# 3. (Optional) Edit the top-level 'env' section as marked with 'üñäÔ∏è' if the defaults are not suitable for your project.
# 4. (Optional) Edit the build-image step to build your project.
#    The default build type is by using a Dockerfile at the root of the repository,
#    but can be replaced with a different file, a source-to-image build, or a step-by-step buildah build.
# 5. Commit and push the workflow file to your default branch to trigger a workflow run.
